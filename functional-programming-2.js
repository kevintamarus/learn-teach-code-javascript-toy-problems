// solve this challenge using multiple functions

/*
you're at a starbucks, you are trying to calculate a customer's total drink price:

small = regular price
medium = 120% regular price
large = 140% regular price

an additional 9% sales tax is added to the subtotal

given the drink order below(drink array), calculate the total price of the customer's drinks

note: price is listed in cents (ex: 1 dollar => price: 100),
extra credit: your function should return in currency format (ex: if total is 1000, you should return "$10.00")

there are many different ways to solve this, functional programming is at your disposal!
